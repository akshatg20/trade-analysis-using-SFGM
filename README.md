# Stochastic-Frontier-Analysis-of-Indian-Trade-Relations-with-ASEAN-and-MERCOSUR
This research paper conducts a Stochastic Frontier Analysis of India’s Trade Relations with ASEAN and MERCOSUR, as part of the course ECO342A: Econometrics II at IIT Kanpur

**Abstract:**

This project seeks to analyse India’s trade relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and MERCOSUR,
as well as the various policies that have emerged in recent years and how they have created new trade opportunities among the
member countries or diverted trade to other members. This would provide a detailed overview of the evolution of trade patterns
and analyse their different ramifications. To achieve this, we will use the stochastic frontier gravity model discussed by Ebaidalla
M. Ebaidalla & Mohammed Elhaj Mustafa Ali (2023), on trade data regarding India’s trade relations with the aforementioned trade
blocs.
